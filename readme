Simple project to demonstrate triggering terraform build/destroy using jenkin pipeline.

Important Notes :
1)Download the terraform plugin in jenkins
2)provide the local terraform path in managejenkins->tools->terraform installation
3)For me jenkin was installed on local desktop,with aws credential already configured as environmental variable.
